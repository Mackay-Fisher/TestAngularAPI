<p>This is a quick demo app based on combining the quick start for Angular based on the CLI commands as well as dotnet ASP API Work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can view the ASP material here: <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code'>Signal Demo</a></li>
  <li>You can view the angualr start up here<a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/angular?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=netcore-cli/'>Angular</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
  <li><strong>Angular CLI integration</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run <code>ng serve</code>. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration automatically invokes <code>ng build</code> to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.</p>
